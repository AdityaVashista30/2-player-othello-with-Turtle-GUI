# 2-player-othello-with-Turtle-GUI-
Using Pyturtle and OS libraries, the game was designed to represent the real-life Othello board game as a multiplayer 2-D computer game where the inputs/moves were entered by the players in a command line window and all animations (supported by sound effects), game flow and scores are simultaneously implemented on the pyturtle screen.
